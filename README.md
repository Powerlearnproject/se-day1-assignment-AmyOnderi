Software Engineering Day1 Assignment


#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software
Its importance in the technology industry is as follows;
Efficiency & Productivity- It helps teams develop software in a structured way, reducing errors and improving productivity.
Reliability- Well-engineered software can handle growth and high user demand. Proper maintenance of the software ensures that failures are minimized.
Security & Risk Management-this is through implementing security measures and ensure that we uphold data protection.
Cost savings-a well-planned software development process reduces the risk of costly errors and rework.
Innovation & Advancement-this is through developing applications, mobile aopplications


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-Defines the project's scope, objectives, and feasibility.
Involves risk assessment, cost estimation, and resource allocation.
Requirement Analysis- Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements.
Ensures clarity between stakeholders and development teams.
Design- Creates architectural and detailed design plans. Covers system architecture, database structure, and user interfaces.
Development-the actual coding of the software
Testing- ensure that the software does not have defects. 
Deployment- Releases the software to users
Maintenance & Support-includes updates and fixing bugs

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology follows a linear and structured approach while the Agile methodology is flexible.
Waterfall projects resist changes once development begins while agile methodology is flexible to change. 
Waterfall requires minimal client input after the initial planning phase, whereas Agile encourages ongoing collaboration, ensuring the final product aligns with user needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software applications
A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards before it is released. They identify defects, improve testing strategies, and ensure a smooth user experience.
A Project Manager oversees the software development process, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and according to specifications. They act as a bridge between stakeholders and the development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDEs:
Code Writing & Editing – IDEs provide syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and intelligent code suggestions, making development faster and reducing errors.
Debugging & Error Detection – Built-in debuggers allow developers to find and fix issues efficiently.
Project Management – IDEs organize project files, dependencies, and configurations for better workflow management.
Code Refactoring – Developers can improve code quality through automated refactoring tools.
Integration with Tools & Frameworks – Most IDEs support plugins for databases, frameworks, and third-party tools.
Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio Code, Jet brains
Importance of VCS:
Collaboration & Teamwork – Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s code.
Tracking & Rollback – Maintains a history of changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
Branching & Merging – Developers can create separate branches for new features and merge them into the main project once tested.
Backup & Recovery – Prevents data loss by storing versions of code on remote repositories.
Example of Version Control Systems are git. 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and Fixing Bugs-identifying and fixing the bugs can be challenging. You can overcome this by using debugging tools. 
Writting codes poorly can lead to slow development. To overcome this, use a refractor and cleaning up the code.  
Technology evolves quickly. To be up to date ensure to continuously learn. 
Tight deadlines. To overcome this, use project management methods. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Tests individual components or functions of a software application in isolation.It ensures that each module works correctly. Is also important in reducing debugging time later on in case it happens. 
Integration Testing- Tests the interaction between multiple components or modules to verify that they work together correctly. identifies whether multiple moduces can communicate by ensuring their compatibility. 
System Testing- Evaluates the entire software system as a whole to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements. verifies that all the components work together as expected. 
Acceptance Testing- determines if the software meets the consumer and business requirements. This confirms that the software is ready for deployment.  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models and obtain the most accurate responses.
Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interaction
Enhancing Response Quality- a clear prompt ensures that the AI ubnderstands the context of the prompt correctly. 
Maximizing AI Capabilities- if prompted correctly, AI can perform complex tasks. 
Reducing Ambiguity and Misinterpretation- this can only be achieved by clear prompts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt- is a state officer an employee?
Improved prompt- Under Kenyan employment law, is a state officer considered an employee and hence governed by the Employment Act?
The improved prompt is clearer because it specifies the jurisdiction, gives the clear context and avoids ambiguity.
